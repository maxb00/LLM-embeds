# Conceptual Analysis - Large Language Models
An exploration into word embeddings generated by LLMs.

## Getting Started

### Cloning
To begin, we must get the source code and cache files from this repository to our target computer. If you have git installed (and are comfortable with it), you can clone easily with `git clone https://github.com/maxb00/LLM-embeds.git` from your OS' command line. Otherwise, you can choose "Download Zip" from the green "Code" button in the top right above (on GitHub); just unzip it where you'd like to work. Once we have our project 'cloned' we need to setup an environment to support our runtime.

### Conda Environment Setup
```
conda env create
```
This will automatically build from the frozen environemnt provided! Current full creation syntax is: 
```
conda create -n aca-dist -c conda-forge pytorch sentencepiece "transformers>=4.20" scikit-learn openai tqdm gensim ipykernel
```
